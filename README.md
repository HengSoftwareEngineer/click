   `npm --version`
> Currently supports only **`npm`**. More package managers will be added in the future.


- **[Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)** — must be installed and added to your system PATH. 
   ➡ *Example Flutter SDK PATH: `C:\src\flutter\bin`*
  
   *To check versions, run:*

### ⬇⬇⬇ Steps to Install

1. **Locate the `setup` folder** in this project.  
2. **Run `clicksetup-2.0.0.exe`** to install the application.  
3. If Windows Defender or another antivirus flags the file:  
   - This is a **false positive** caused by the app not being code-signed or registered with Microsoft.  
   - It is safe to proceed — simply choose **"More info" → "Run anyway"**.  
   - You can also verify the installer’s source files in the [`\setup\ui`](./setup/ui) folder before proceeding.
